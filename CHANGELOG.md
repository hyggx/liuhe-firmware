## [Unreleased]

### UI — 设置菜单全面优化 (2026-05-18, `main`)

Flash budget: `text 59 912 B / 61 440 B` (`ENABLE_CHINESE=1`, default config).

- **`ui/menu.c` — 上下布局代替左右双栏** —
  原版左侧显示设置名、右侧显示值的双栏布局改为上下结构：标题栏（pages 0-1）
  显示设置名称（大字），下方值区（pages 2-7）居中显示设置内容。消除中文名称
  右侧出界、设置值截断等问题。

- **`ui/menu.c` — 标题栏布局：左名右计数** —
  设置名称左对齐，`N/Total` 计数器右对齐，两者同在 page 0 行，page 1 底部
  保留点状分隔线。避免计数器与分隔线重叠导致的字符越界问题。

- **`ui/menu.c` / `ui/helper.c` — 中文内容居中显示** —
  `UI_PrintStringMixed` 新增预测量 pass：先扫描字符串计算总像素宽
  （CJK=13 px，ASCII=8 px），再相对 `Start..End` 计算居中偏移，使中文
  设置名称和设置值均居中，与英文模式行为一致。

- **`ui/menu.c` — 编辑指示符改为 `>`** —
  原实心箭头 Bitmap 改为大字体 `>` 字符，显示于值区右侧（page 2-3 右边），
  更清晰且不遮挡内容。

- **`ui/menu.c` — 功率值去掉 `~` 前缀** —
  `~0.5W / ~2W / ~5W` → `0.5W / 2W / 5W`。

- **`ui/menu.c` / `ui/menu_lang.c` — CTCS → CTCSS（正确全称）** —
  英文菜单名 `RxCTCS/TxCTCS` → `RxCTCSS/TxCTCSS`；
  中文 `接收CTCS/发射CTCS` → `接收CTCSS/发射CTCSS`。
  `t_menu_item.name[]` 数组从 7 字节扩展到 9 字节以容纳更长名称。

- **`ui/menu_lang.c` — 中文菜单名优化** —

  | 原文 | 新文 |
  |------|------|
  | 存信道 | 保存信道 |
  | 删信道 | 删除信道 |
  | 命名信道 | 命名信道（不变） |
  | 信道显示 → 名+频 | 信道显示 → 名称+频率 |
  | 静噪 | 静噪 |
  | 显示语言 | 语言 |
  | 偏移向 | 频差方向 |
  | 偏移频 | 频差频率 |
  | 忙锁 | 繁忙锁定 |
  | 省电 | 省电模式 |

- **`tools/gen_cjk_font.py` / `tools/cjk_font.bin` — 字体扩充至 143 字** —
  新增"保"、"除"等菜单所需汉字；字体二进制重新生成（4 014 字节，26 bytes/glyph）。

- **`ui/menu.c` — 3-4 行内容项不再溢出** —
  存/删/命名信道、按键即呼等多行内容项通过缩小行距、调整起始行号适配 pages 2-7。

### Chinese localisation — language audit fixes (branch: `main`)

Flash budget (2026-05-18, `ENABLE_CHINESE=1`, default config):
`text 60 860 B / 61 440 B` — **580 B free**
(`ENABLE_FLASHLIGHT` and `ENABLE_VOX` auto-disabled to fit CJK renderer).

- **[P1] `board.c` / `Makefile` — CRC peripheral not initialised for CN-only builds** —
  `CRC_Init()` in `BOARD_Init()` was guarded by
  `#if defined(ENABLE_UART) || defined(ENABLED_AIRCOPY)`.
  Two bugs: (1) `ENABLED_AIRCOPY` is a typo — the correct macro is `ENABLE_AIRCOPY`;
  (2) `ENABLE_CHINESE` was absent, so a build with
  `ENABLE_CHINESE=1 ENABLE_UART=0` would call `CRC_Calculate()` from
  `UI_PrintStringMixed` without the CRC peripheral being clocked, causing
  a fault.
  Fix: typo corrected to `ENABLE_AIRCOPY`; `defined(ENABLE_CHINESE)` added to
  the `#if` guard.  Matching fix in `Makefile`: `ENABLE_CHINESE` added to the
  `$(filter ...)` condition that selects `driver/crc.o`, ensuring the object is
  always linked for CN builds regardless of `ENABLE_UART`.

- **[P1] `ui/menu.c` — non-custom menu branch rendered Chinese titles with ASCII font** —
  `#ifndef ENABLE_CUSTOM_MENU_LAYOUT` path called `UI_PrintString(title, …, 8)`
  directly, which uses the built-in ASCII 8×8 font.  With `ENABLE_CHINESE=1` and
  `ENABLE_CUSTOM_MENU_LAYOUT=0`, all three visible menu-title rows were rendered as
  garbled ASCII glyphs.
  Fix: replaced with `SUBV_PRINT(title, …)`, which expands to
  `UI_PrintStringMixed` in CN builds (EEPROM CJK font lookup) or
  `UI_PrintString(…, 8)` in non-CN builds (existing behaviour unchanged).

- **[P2] CJK font binary — 8-byte header with magic, version, CRC-16/CCITT** —
  The font binary written to EEPROM at `0x2000` previously had no integrity
  metadata.  A blank or stale EEPROM caused `UI_PrintStringMixed` to read
  arbitrary data as a glyph table, producing garbage or out-of-bounds reads.
  New header layout (8 bytes, little-endian):

  | Offset | Field      | Value  | Notes                         |
  |--------|------------|--------|-------------------------------|
  | 0–1    | `magic`    | 0x4B36 | 'K','6' LE                    |
  | 2–3    | `count`    | n      | glyph count                   |
  | 4      | `version`  | 1      |                               |
  | 5      | `pad`      | 0      |                               |
  | 6–7    | `crc16`    | –      | CRC-16/CCITT over bytes 0–5   |

  `ui/helper.c` `UI_PrintStringMixed`: reads header, validates magic, version,
  and CRC (using `CRC_Calculate`); silently skips CJK rendering on failure.
  `tools/gen_cjk_font.py`: emits the header; software CRC matches the
  DP32G030 hardware peripheral (poly 0x1021, init 0, no reflection).
  Also updated to scan `ui/menu.c` for codepoints in addition to
  `ui/menu_lang.c` and `ui/menu_sub_values_cn.c`.

- **[P2] `app/uart.c` CMD_051B — EEPROM read boundary extended to 64 KB** —
  EEPROM constants updated: `EEPROM_SIZE = 0x10000u`, `EEPROM_FONT_BASE = 0x2000u`
  in `driver/eeprom.h`.  CMD_051B guard now checks
  `Offset + Size <= EEPROM_SIZE` (was `Offset + Size <= 0x2000`), allowing
  UART reads of the full AT24C512 address space including the font region.

- **[P2] `ui/menu_sub_values_cn.c` / `ui/menu.c` — missing Chinese sub-menu values** —
  Three sub-menu cases in `MENU_DrawValues` always displayed English strings
  regardless of the active UI language:
  - `MENU_AL_MOD`: now uses existing `gSubMenu_AL_MOD_CN[]` via `SUBV()`.
  - `MENU_F_LOCK`: added `gSubMenu_F_LOCK_CN[F_LOCK_LEN]` with translated
    band-plan labels; the "READ MANUAL" unlock-confirmation string mapped to
    "阅读\n手册".
  - `MENU_F1SHRT` / `MENU_F1LONG` / `MENU_F2SHRT` / `MENU_F2LONG` / `MENU_MLONG`
    (side-key function names): added `gSidefuncCN[ACTION_OPT_LEN]` indexed by
    `t_sidefunction.id` (`ACTION_OPT_t`), covering all 15 `ACTION_OPT_*` values.
  Extern declarations added to `ui/menu_sub_values_cn.h`.

- **[P2] `ui/helper.h` — `SUBV_PRINT` dispatch macro** —
  Added `SUBV_PRINT(str, x1, x2, line)`:
  expands to `UI_PrintStringMixed(…)` in CN builds,
  `UI_PrintString(…, 8)` in non-CN builds.
  Used throughout `ui/menu.c` to display the currently-selected menu title
  in the appropriate font without call-site `#ifdef` chains.

- **[P2] `ui/menu.c` — adjacent menu items: compile-time → runtime language check** —
  The two `while` loops that draw neighbouring (smaller-font) menu items in the
  custom layout were wrapped in `#ifndef ENABLE_CHINESE`, causing them to be
  compiled out entirely in CN builds.  Consequence: with `ENABLE_CHINESE=1` but
  `gUiLanguage == UI_LANGUAGE_EN` (English selected at runtime), the neighbouring
  items were never drawn.
  Fix: guards replaced with `#ifdef ENABLE_CHINESE if (gUiLanguage != UI_LANGUAGE_CN)`
  so adjacent items are drawn whenever the active language is not Chinese, regardless
  of how the firmware was compiled.

- **[build] `Makefile` — auto-disable `FLASHLIGHT` and `VOX` for CN builds** —
  `ENABLE_CHINESE=1` now automatically sets `ENABLE_FLASHLIGHT := 0` and
  `ENABLE_VOX := 0` to reclaim the ~1.4 KB needed by the CJK renderer and
  string tables without exceeding the 61 440 B flash limit.

- **[build] `Makefile` — link map output and clean target** —
  Added `-Wl,-Map=firmware.map` to `LDFLAGS`; `firmware.map` added to `clean` target.
  Enables precise per-symbol flash analysis via `grep` on the map file.

- **[tool] `tools/flash_font.py` — write-back verification enabled by default** —
  Verify pass (read-back and compare every written block) is now performed
  automatically after writing.  Pass `--no-verify` to skip.  Previously
  verification required the explicit `--verify` flag.

### Fixed — AM Fix bugs (branch: `k6-hardening`)

- **[P1] `radio.c` `RADIO_SetupAGC`** —
  Both `listeningAM` and `disable` parameters were shifted left by 1,
  placing them in the same bit position of `newSettings`.  The change-detect
  guard (`if lastSettings == newSettings return`) therefore ignored any
  change in `disable` when `listeningAM=1`, preventing the AGC from being
  updated when the Spectrum app toggled `lockAGC`.  Fix: `disable` now
  occupies bit 0.

- **[P1] `am_fix.c` `desired_rssi`** —
  Target RF level changed from −89 dBm to −95 dBm.  100% AM modulation
  produces sideband peaks at carrier +6 dB; targeting −89 dBm left no
  headroom for heavily-modulated broadcast audio, causing occasional
  clipping artefacts on music/full-modulation speech.  −95 dBm provides
  exactly the 6 dB headroom required.

- **[P2] `am_fix.c` `AM_fix_init`** —
  Gain table index initialised to `gain_table_size − 1` (0 dB, max gain)
  instead of 0 (the isolated "original" −7 dB entry).  Previously, on a
  signal below −95 dBm at boot, the control loop would step from index 0
  to index 1 = −93 dB (an 86 dB gain drop) before ramping back up over
  ~420 ms.  Starting at max gain means weak signals are immediately
  receivable; strong signals are attenuated on the very first 10 ms tick.

- **[P3] `am_fix.c` `AM_fix_10ms` RSSI filter** —
  Replaced the 2-tap FIR average with a first-order IIR low-pass filter
  (α = 0.25, time constant ≈ 30 ms).  The old code stored the raw RSSI
  reading as `prev_rssi` and averaged raw + raw; the new code stores the
  *smoothed* value and updates it each tick via
  `filtered += (raw − filtered) >> 2`.  Noise-spike rejection improved
  from 50% attenuation (FIR) to 75% (IIR), reducing spurious gain hunting
  on impulsive interference.

### Fixed — RSSI measurement bugs (branch: `k6-hardening`)

- **[P2] `driver/bk4819.c` `BK4819_GetRSSI_dBm`** —
  Integer division `raw / 2` always truncates toward zero, causing a
  systematic −0.5 dBm bias on every odd raw value (visible as a 1 dBm
  "staircase" where two adjacent raw readings map to the same displayed
  value).  Fix: `(raw + 1) / 2` rounds to nearest 1 dBm instead.
  Same fix applied to `Rssi2DBm()` in `app/spectrum.c`.

- **[P2] `am_fix.c` `AM_fix_10ms` `currentGainDiff` reference point** —
  The gain-compensation term added to the RSSI display was computed as
  `gain_table[0].gain_dB − current_gain_dB`, where `gain_table[0].gain_dB`
  is the "original register" entry at −7 dB.  Using −7 dB as the reference
  instead of 0 dB introduced a constant −7 dBm error in the S-meter
  whenever AM Fix was at maximum gain (no attenuation).  Fix: reference is
  now 0 dB: `currentGainDiff = −current_gain_dB`.  Result: displayed level
  is accurate at all gain steps, with zero correction error at full gain.

- **[P3] `ui/main.c` `DisplayRSSIBar` — single-sample display instability** —
  The 500 ms display update took a single point-sample of REG_67 with no
  temporal averaging.  On marginal signals or in the presence of impulse
  noise, the displayed dBm value could jump ±5–10 dBm between ticks,
  making the S-meter hard to read.  Added a first-order IIR low-pass filter
  (α = ½, τ ≈ 500 ms) on the final corrected dBm value.  Each 500 ms
  sample contributes 50% weight; the smoother reseeds immediately on VFO
  change so stale readings from the previous channel are never displayed.

### Fixed — Squelch hysteresis inversion (branch: `k6-hardening`)

- **[P1] `radio.c` `RADIO_ConfigureSquelchAndOutputPower`** —
  Fixed two squelch Schmitt-trigger invariant violations in the
  `ENABLE_SQUELCH_MORE_SENSITIVE` path.

  **Root cause:** The upstream code scaled only the *open* thresholds
  (`rssi_open ÷ 2`, `noise_open × 2`) while leaving the corresponding
  *close* thresholds at their original EEPROM values.  After scaling:

  | Threshold | Before fix | After fix |
  |-----------|-----------|-----------|
  | RSSI open | 50 → **25** | 50 → **25** |
  | RSSI close | 40 (unchanged) → **close > open** ✗ | 40 → **20** ✓ |
  | Noise open | 65 → **127** (sat) | 65 → **127** (sat) |
  | Noise close | 70 (unchanged) → **close < open** ✗ | 70 → **127** (sat) ✓ |

  With `rssi_close(40) > rssi_open(25)` the BK4819 hardware squelch
  would open at RSSI=25 but immediately satisfy the close condition
  (RSSI ≤ 40), producing chatter on weak signals (RSSI 25–40).
  The symptom was masked in practice only by the REG_4E time-domain
  delays (`open_delay=5`, `close_delay=6`).

  **Fix:** Scale both open and close thresholds by the same factor.
  The hysteresis window shrinks proportionally but the Schmitt direction
  is preserved.  Post-scale invariant guards cover any residual edge cases.

  *Example VHF Sql=5 (EEPROM default values):*
  - RSSI: open 50→25, close 40→20 — hysteresis 10→5 (proportional) ✓
  - Noise: both saturate at 127 — noise criterion disabled in hi-sens mode ✓
  - Glitch: open 100→200 (×2), close 90 (unchanged) — wide window ✓

  **Field verification (2026-05-17):**
  Tested on UV-K6 V1 with Huahong S518+ 8 cm stub antenna (lower gain than
  stock antenna; signal more likely to dwell in the squelch boundary zone).
  At ~−100 dBm (S4–S6) on a UHF simplex frequency, stock V1 firmware
  exhibited audible background noise bursts consistent with squelch chatter
  in the RSSI 25–40 hysteresis-inversion window.  Hygg firmware (this fix)
  produced clean, stable audio under identical conditions.  Hardware and
  antenna unchanged between tests; improvement confirmed as firmware-only.

### Ham Core — Phase 4a (branch: `k6-hardening`, commit: `46eca1c`)

Flash budget (2026-05-17 measured, current config):
`text 57528 B / 61440 B` — **3912 B free**.

- **[ham] `settings.c` — S-meter IARU R1 default calibration** —
  Changed default S0/S9 levels from 130/76 to **127/73** to comply with IARU
  Region 1 Technical Recommendation R.1: S9 = −73 dBm, 6 dB per S-unit,
  giving S0 = −127 dBm.  The 54 dBm / 9 S-unit span is unchanged; only
  the absolute S9 reference is corrected by 3 dBm.  Takes effect on factory
  reset or first boot with uninitialised EEPROM.

- **[fix] `ui/main.c` — `ENABLE_RSSI_BAR=0` build failure** —
  Static IIR state variables (`rssi_disp_dBm`, `rssi_disp_seeded`,
  `rssi_disp_vfo`) were declared outside the `#ifdef ENABLE_RSSI_BAR` guard,
  causing `-Werror=unused-variable` when the feature was disabled.  Wrapped
  in the appropriate `#ifdef`; all build configurations now compile cleanly.

- **[security] `app/uart.c` `SendVersion` — bounded version string copy** —
  Replaced `strcpy(Reply.Data.Version, Version)` with
  `strncpy(..., sizeof − 1)` plus explicit null termination.  Eliminates
  the latent buffer overflow if `AUTHOR_STRING` or `VERSION_STRING` is ever
  lengthened beyond 14 characters.

### Config — FM radio enabled, DTMF calling removed (branch: `k6-hardening`, commit: `f4293a0`)

Flash budget (2026-05-17 measured, field-verified):
`text 58960 B / 61440 B` — **2480 B free**.

- **[config] `Makefile` — `ENABLE_FMRADIO=1`** —
  FM WBFM broadcast receiver re-enabled (was disabled at project start).
  Adds `driver/bk1080.o`, `app/fm.o`, `ui/fmradio.o` — measured cost
  ~4.7 KB, not the originally estimated 1 KB.

- **[config] `Makefile` — `ENABLE_DTMF_CALLING=0`** —
  DTMF calling protocol disabled to reclaim 3300 B needed to fit FM radio.
  This removes the ANI-ID / contact-list / ring-reply call protocol only.
  The following DTMF features are **unaffected**: manual code entry before
  PTT (repeater access), PTT-ID auto UP/DOWN code, DTMF side-tone, preload
  time, and live DTMF decoder display.  Menu item count: 60 → **55** items
  (removed: `ANI ID`, `D Resp`, `D Hold`, `D Decd`, `D List`).

  **Field verification (2026-05-17):** FM reception, all remaining menu
  items, VFO/MR operation, and PTT-ID confirmed working on UV-K6 V1 hardware.

### TX lock default + build profiles (branch: `k6-hardening`)

- **[hardening] `settings.c` `SETTINGS_InitEEPROM`** —
  TX-frequency lock fallback on invalid/blank EEPROM changed from
  `F_LOCK_DEF` (permissive stock bands) to `DEFAULT_F_LOCK`, a
  compile-time constant.  This value is `F_LOCK_ALL` (all TX disabled)
  for the release profile and `F_LOCK_DEF` for the debug profile.
  Existing user EEPROM values are **never overwritten** on normal boot;
  the fallback only applies when `Data[0] >= F_LOCK_LEN` (0xFF on
  brand-new or blank EEPROM).  TX lock can still be changed via the
  hidden menu (PTT + upper side-key at power-on → `F LOCK`).

- **[build] `Makefile` — `PROFILE` variable** —
  Added profile-based build system.  `PROFILE ?= release` selects
  `profiles/release.mk` by default; override with `make PROFILE=debug`.

  | Profile | `DEFAULT_F_LOCK` | debug flags | UART BK regs |
  |---------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
  | release | `F_LOCK_ALL`    | off         | off          |
  | debug   | `F_LOCK_DEF`    | on          | on           |

  Profile files use `:=` so they take precedence over any subsequent
  `?=` defaults in the main Makefile.  Flash budget is identical for
  both profiles (`text 58960 B`); the debug flags add negligible code
  with LTO.

### Security — Phase 1 (branch: `k6-hardening`)

Confirmed fixes applied.  Flash budget note: the `text 61396 B` figure below
was measured with `ENABLE_FMRADIO=1`; current config (`FMRADIO=0`) measures
`text 57428 B / 61440 B` (3912 B free before the Phase 4a commit above).

- **[P0] `driver/eeprom.c`** — `EEPROM_WriteBuffer`: corrected upper-bound check from
  `Address >= 0x2000` to `Address > (0x2000 - 8)` so the 8-byte page write cannot
  walk past the end of the 8 KB EEPROM address space.
- **[P0] `app/uart.c` CMD_051B** — Added runtime guard: reject UART read requests
  where `pCmd->Size > 128` (the reply data buffer size); previously a malformed frame
  could cause `EEPROM_ReadBuffer` to overflow `Reply.Data.Data[]` and leak stack data.
- **[P0] `app/uart.c` CMD_051D** — Added runtime guard: reject UART write requests
  where `Offset + Size > 0x2000`; previously an adversary could supply a large offset
  to walk I2C writes past the end of the EEPROM.
- **[P1] `app/uart.c` SendVersion** — Added comment documenting that `strcpy` into
  `Version[16]` is safe for the current `AUTHOR_STRING` + `VERSION_STRING` length
  (15 chars + null = exactly 16 bytes); flagged for `strncpy` conversion if string grows.
- **[P1] `radio.c` `RADIO_ApplyOffset`** — Fixed dead condition in aviation-band check:
  `frequency >= .upper && frequency < .upper` is always false; corrected to
  `frequency >= .lower && frequency < .upper` so TX offset is properly disabled for
  the 108–137 MHz AM aviation band.
- **[P1] `driver/bk4819.c` `BK4819_SetAGC`** — Added explanatory comment clarifying
  that the `!(regVal & (1 << 15)) == enable` expression is logically correct as
  written (C precedence applies `!` before `==` for this expression with parentheses).

### Fixed — AM Fix follow-up bugs (self-audit, branch: `k6-hardening`)

- **[P2] `am_fix.c` `AM_fix_reset` — gain index not reset to max gain** —
  `AM_fix_init()` was corrected (prior commit) to start at `gain_table_size − 1`
  (0 dB, maximum gain), but `AM_fix_reset()` — called on every frequency change —
  still left `gain_table_index[vfo]` at whatever the previous channel had set it to.
  Tuning from a strong AM station (where the AGC had reduced the index to a low-gain
  value) to a weak station caused ~400 ms of near-silence while the AGC ramped the
  index back up to maximum.  Fix: `AM_fix_reset()` now also sets
  `gain_table_index[vfo] = gain_table_size − 1`.

- **[P2] `am_fix.c` `currentGainDiff` — single global, not per-VFO** —
  `currentGainDiff` was a single `int8_t` updated by `AM_fix_10ms(vfo)` for whichever
  VFO was last processed.  In dual-watch mode with both VFOs on AM, the S-meter in
  `DisplayRSSIBar` would apply the gain compensation from the *last-processed* VFO
  rather than the *currently-displayed* VFO, producing an incorrect dBm reading.
  Fix: changed to `int8_t currentGainDiff[2]` (indexed by VFO); `AM_fix_get_gain_diff`
  now takes an `unsigned vfo` parameter.  Call sites updated:
  `ui/main.c` passes `gEeprom.RX_VFO`; `app/spectrum.c` passes the module-scope `vfo`.

- **[P3] `driver/bk4819.c` comment arithmetic error** —
  The `BK4819_GetRSSI_dBm` documentation comment stated
  `raw 511 → −104.5 dBm`, but `(511 + 1) / 2 − 160 = +96 dBm`.
  Corrected to `raw 130 → −95 dBm`, which matches the AM Fix AGC target and is
  easily verified: `130 × 0.5 − 160 = −95 dBm`.

### Scanner — Priority-channel insertion rate reduced (commit: `f26854a`)

- **[fix] `app/chFrScanner.c` — `SCAN_PRIORITY_INTERVAL`** —
  Priority-channel check was inserted after every scanned channel
  (`SCAN_PRIORITY_INTERVAL = 1`).  On a busy band this caused the
  scanner to stall on the priority channel entry for every step, making
  forward progress nearly imperceptible.  Changed to
  `SCAN_PRIORITY_INTERVAL = 8`: the priority check fires once every
  8 scanned channels, reducing interruptions by 87.5 % while still
  giving the priority channel roughly one check per second at normal
  scan speeds.

### Fixed — 6.25 kHz bandwidth exposed in W_N menu + weak-signal filter bug (commit: `3402875`)

Flash budget (2026-05-18 measured):
`text 59 000 B / 61 440 B` — **2 440 B free**.

- **[fix] `ui/menu.c` / `ui/menu.h` — `gSubMenu_W_N` missing NARROWER entry** —
  The `BK4819_FILTER_BW_NARROWER` (6.25 kHz) enum value was already
  handled in `bk4819.c` and used in `app/spectrum.c`, but the W_N menu
  array was declared as `[2][7]` and contained only `{"WIDE", "NARROW"}`.
  Any code that wrote `NARROWER` to EEPROM would read back a display of
  `WIDE` (index 0 wrap), silently discarding the user's choice.
  Fix: array extended to `[3][7]`; third entry added as `"NARRW"` (truncated
  to fit the 6-character field width).  Users can now select 6.25 kHz via

- **[P2] `driver/bk4819.c` `BK4819_SetFilterBandwidth` NARROWER weak-signal path** —
  In the `BK4819_FILTER_BW_NARROWER` case, the `val` initialiser included
  `(3u << 9)` unconditionally.  The `if (weak_no_different)` branch then
  OR'd `(3u << 9)` again (no-op), and the `else` branch OR'd `(0u << 9)`
  (also a no-op).  Both paths therefore produced the identical register
  value `0x3658`, making the "weak signal" variant of NARROWER identical
  to the normal variant — the bits[11:9] field was never cleared.
  Fix: `(3u << 9)` removed from the initialiser; the strong-signal path
  OR's it in to produce `0x3658`; the weak-signal path leaves bits[11:9]
  at zero, producing `0x3058` — the correct lower-bandwidth setting for
  weak-signal AM reception.

### Deferred — requires design / more analysis

- `app/dtmf.c` `DTMF_FindContact` — unbounded `pResult` write; all current callers
  pass adequately-sized buffers; API change is invasive, deferred to Phase 2.
- `am_fix.c` `memmove` size error — the buggy path is under `#if !LOOKUP_TABLE`
  which is compile-time dead (`#define LOOKUP_TABLE 1`); deferred.
- `driver/uart.c` interrupt-disable scope — architectural change, needs careful design.
- `audio.c` voice queue — only active when `ENABLE_VOICE` is set (off by default).
- `app/spectrum.c` RSSI busy-wait / `driver/bk4819.c` IRQ loop — behavioural change
  risk, deferred.
