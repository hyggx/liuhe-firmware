## [Unreleased]

### Fixed — AM Fix bugs (branch: `k6-hardening`)

- **[P1] `radio.c` `RADIO_SetupAGC`** —
  Both `listeningAM` and `disable` parameters were shifted left by 1,
  placing them in the same bit position of `newSettings`.  The change-detect
  guard (`if lastSettings == newSettings return`) therefore ignored any
  change in `disable` when `listeningAM=1`, preventing the AGC from being
  updated when the Spectrum app toggled `lockAGC`.  Fix: `disable` now
  occupies bit 0.

- **[P1] `am_fix.c` `desired_rssi`** —
  Target RF level changed from −89 dBm to −95 dBm.  100% AM modulation
  produces sideband peaks at carrier +6 dB; targeting −89 dBm left no
  headroom for heavily-modulated broadcast audio, causing occasional
  clipping artefacts on music/full-modulation speech.  −95 dBm provides
  exactly the 6 dB headroom required.

- **[P2] `am_fix.c` `AM_fix_init`** —
  Gain table index initialised to `gain_table_size − 1` (0 dB, max gain)
  instead of 0 (the isolated "original" −7 dB entry).  Previously, on a
  signal below −95 dBm at boot, the control loop would step from index 0
  to index 1 = −93 dB (an 86 dB gain drop) before ramping back up over
  ~420 ms.  Starting at max gain means weak signals are immediately
  receivable; strong signals are attenuated on the very first 10 ms tick.

- **[P3] `am_fix.c` `AM_fix_10ms` RSSI filter** —
  Replaced the 2-tap FIR average with a first-order IIR low-pass filter
  (α = 0.25, time constant ≈ 30 ms).  The old code stored the raw RSSI
  reading as `prev_rssi` and averaged raw + raw; the new code stores the
  *smoothed* value and updates it each tick via
  `filtered += (raw − filtered) >> 2`.  Noise-spike rejection improved
  from 50% attenuation (FIR) to 75% (IIR), reducing spurious gain hunting
  on impulsive interference.

### Fixed — RSSI measurement bugs (branch: `k6-hardening`)

- **[P2] `driver/bk4819.c` `BK4819_GetRSSI_dBm`** —
  Integer division `raw / 2` always truncates toward zero, causing a
  systematic −0.5 dBm bias on every odd raw value (visible as a 1 dBm
  "staircase" where two adjacent raw readings map to the same displayed
  value).  Fix: `(raw + 1) / 2` rounds to nearest 1 dBm instead.
  Same fix applied to `Rssi2DBm()` in `app/spectrum.c`.

- **[P2] `am_fix.c` `AM_fix_10ms` `currentGainDiff` reference point** —
  The gain-compensation term added to the RSSI display was computed as
  `gain_table[0].gain_dB − current_gain_dB`, where `gain_table[0].gain_dB`
  is the "original register" entry at −7 dB.  Using −7 dB as the reference
  instead of 0 dB introduced a constant −7 dBm error in the S-meter
  whenever AM Fix was at maximum gain (no attenuation).  Fix: reference is
  now 0 dB: `currentGainDiff = −current_gain_dB`.  Result: displayed level
  is accurate at all gain steps, with zero correction error at full gain.

- **[P3] `ui/main.c` `DisplayRSSIBar` — single-sample display instability** —
  The 500 ms display update took a single point-sample of REG_67 with no
  temporal averaging.  On marginal signals or in the presence of impulse
  noise, the displayed dBm value could jump ±5–10 dBm between ticks,
  making the S-meter hard to read.  Added a first-order IIR low-pass filter
  (α = ½, τ ≈ 500 ms) on the final corrected dBm value.  Each 500 ms
  sample contributes 50% weight; the smoother reseeds immediately on VFO
  change so stale readings from the previous channel are never displayed.

### Fixed — Squelch hysteresis inversion (branch: `k6-hardening`)

- **[P1] `radio.c` `RADIO_ConfigureSquelchAndOutputPower`** —
  Fixed two squelch Schmitt-trigger invariant violations in the
  `ENABLE_SQUELCH_MORE_SENSITIVE` path.

  **Root cause:** The upstream code scaled only the *open* thresholds
  (`rssi_open ÷ 2`, `noise_open × 2`) while leaving the corresponding
  *close* thresholds at their original EEPROM values.  After scaling:

  | Threshold | Before fix | After fix |
  |-----------|-----------|-----------|
  | RSSI open | 50 → **25** | 50 → **25** |
  | RSSI close | 40 (unchanged) → **close > open** ✗ | 40 → **20** ✓ |
  | Noise open | 65 → **127** (sat) | 65 → **127** (sat) |
  | Noise close | 70 (unchanged) → **close < open** ✗ | 70 → **127** (sat) ✓ |

  With `rssi_close(40) > rssi_open(25)` the BK4819 hardware squelch
  would open at RSSI=25 but immediately satisfy the close condition
  (RSSI ≤ 40), producing chatter on weak signals (RSSI 25–40).
  The symptom was masked in practice only by the REG_4E time-domain
  delays (`open_delay=5`, `close_delay=6`).

  **Fix:** Scale both open and close thresholds by the same factor.
  The hysteresis window shrinks proportionally but the Schmitt direction
  is preserved.  Post-scale invariant guards cover any residual edge cases.

  *Example VHF Sql=5 (EEPROM default values):*
  - RSSI: open 50→25, close 40→20 — hysteresis 10→5 (proportional) ✓
  - Noise: both saturate at 127 — noise criterion disabled in hi-sens mode ✓
  - Glitch: open 100→200 (×2), close 90 (unchanged) — wide window ✓

  **Field verification (2026-05-17):**
  Tested on UV-K6 V1 with Huahong S518+ 8 cm stub antenna (lower gain than
  stock antenna; signal more likely to dwell in the squelch boundary zone).
  At ~−100 dBm (S4–S6) on a UHF simplex frequency, stock V1 firmware
  exhibited audible background noise bursts consistent with squelch chatter
  in the RSSI 25–40 hysteresis-inversion window.  Hygg firmware (this fix)
  produced clean, stable audio under identical conditions.  Hardware and
  antenna unchanged between tests; improvement confirmed as firmware-only.

### Ham Core — Phase 4a (branch: `k6-hardening`, commit: `46eca1c`)

Flash budget (2026-05-17 measured, current config):
`text 57528 B / 61440 B` — **3912 B free**.

- **[ham] `settings.c` — S-meter IARU R1 default calibration** —
  Changed default S0/S9 levels from 130/76 to **127/73** to comply with IARU
  Region 1 Technical Recommendation R.1: S9 = −73 dBm, 6 dB per S-unit,
  giving S0 = −127 dBm.  The 54 dBm / 9 S-unit span is unchanged; only
  the absolute S9 reference is corrected by 3 dBm.  Takes effect on factory
  reset or first boot with uninitialised EEPROM.

- **[fix] `ui/main.c` — `ENABLE_RSSI_BAR=0` build failure** —
  Static IIR state variables (`rssi_disp_dBm`, `rssi_disp_seeded`,
  `rssi_disp_vfo`) were declared outside the `#ifdef ENABLE_RSSI_BAR` guard,
  causing `-Werror=unused-variable` when the feature was disabled.  Wrapped
  in the appropriate `#ifdef`; all build configurations now compile cleanly.

- **[security] `app/uart.c` `SendVersion` — bounded version string copy** —
  Replaced `strcpy(Reply.Data.Version, Version)` with
  `strncpy(..., sizeof − 1)` plus explicit null termination.  Eliminates
  the latent buffer overflow if `AUTHOR_STRING` or `VERSION_STRING` is ever
  lengthened beyond 14 characters.

### Config — FM radio enabled, DTMF calling removed (branch: `k6-hardening`, commit: `f4293a0`)

Flash budget (2026-05-17 measured, field-verified):
`text 58960 B / 61440 B` — **2480 B free**.

- **[config] `Makefile` — `ENABLE_FMRADIO=1`** —
  FM WBFM broadcast receiver re-enabled (was disabled at project start).
  Adds `driver/bk1080.o`, `app/fm.o`, `ui/fmradio.o` — measured cost
  ~4.7 KB, not the originally estimated 1 KB.

- **[config] `Makefile` — `ENABLE_DTMF_CALLING=0`** —
  DTMF calling protocol disabled to reclaim 3300 B needed to fit FM radio.
  This removes the ANI-ID / contact-list / ring-reply call protocol only.
  The following DTMF features are **unaffected**: manual code entry before
  PTT (repeater access), PTT-ID auto UP/DOWN code, DTMF side-tone, preload
  time, and live DTMF decoder display.  Menu item count: 60 → **55** items
  (removed: `ANI ID`, `D Resp`, `D Hold`, `D Decd`, `D List`).

  **Field verification (2026-05-17):** FM reception, all remaining menu
  items, VFO/MR operation, and PTT-ID confirmed working on UV-K6 V1 hardware.

### Security — Phase 1 (branch: `k6-hardening`)

Confirmed fixes applied.  Flash budget note: the `text 61396 B` figure below
was measured with `ENABLE_FMRADIO=1`; current config (`FMRADIO=0`) measures
`text 57428 B / 61440 B` (3912 B free before the Phase 4a commit above).

- **[P0] `driver/eeprom.c`** — `EEPROM_WriteBuffer`: corrected upper-bound check from
  `Address >= 0x2000` to `Address > (0x2000 - 8)` so the 8-byte page write cannot
  walk past the end of the 8 KB EEPROM address space.
- **[P0] `app/uart.c` CMD_051B** — Added runtime guard: reject UART read requests
  where `pCmd->Size > 128` (the reply data buffer size); previously a malformed frame
  could cause `EEPROM_ReadBuffer` to overflow `Reply.Data.Data[]` and leak stack data.
- **[P0] `app/uart.c` CMD_051D** — Added runtime guard: reject UART write requests
  where `Offset + Size > 0x2000`; previously an adversary could supply a large offset
  to walk I2C writes past the end of the EEPROM.
- **[P1] `app/uart.c` SendVersion** — Added comment documenting that `strcpy` into
  `Version[16]` is safe for the current `AUTHOR_STRING` + `VERSION_STRING` length
  (15 chars + null = exactly 16 bytes); flagged for `strncpy` conversion if string grows.
- **[P1] `radio.c` `RADIO_ApplyOffset`** — Fixed dead condition in aviation-band check:
  `frequency >= .upper && frequency < .upper` is always false; corrected to
  `frequency >= .lower && frequency < .upper` so TX offset is properly disabled for
  the 108–137 MHz AM aviation band.
- **[P1] `driver/bk4819.c` `BK4819_SetAGC`** — Added explanatory comment clarifying
  that the `!(regVal & (1 << 15)) == enable` expression is logically correct as
  written (C precedence applies `!` before `==` for this expression with parentheses).

### Fixed — AM Fix follow-up bugs (self-audit, branch: `k6-hardening`)

- **[P2] `am_fix.c` `AM_fix_reset` — gain index not reset to max gain** —
  `AM_fix_init()` was corrected (prior commit) to start at `gain_table_size − 1`
  (0 dB, maximum gain), but `AM_fix_reset()` — called on every frequency change —
  still left `gain_table_index[vfo]` at whatever the previous channel had set it to.
  Tuning from a strong AM station (where the AGC had reduced the index to a low-gain
  value) to a weak station caused ~400 ms of near-silence while the AGC ramped the
  index back up to maximum.  Fix: `AM_fix_reset()` now also sets
  `gain_table_index[vfo] = gain_table_size − 1`.

- **[P2] `am_fix.c` `currentGainDiff` — single global, not per-VFO** —
  `currentGainDiff` was a single `int8_t` updated by `AM_fix_10ms(vfo)` for whichever
  VFO was last processed.  In dual-watch mode with both VFOs on AM, the S-meter in
  `DisplayRSSIBar` would apply the gain compensation from the *last-processed* VFO
  rather than the *currently-displayed* VFO, producing an incorrect dBm reading.
  Fix: changed to `int8_t currentGainDiff[2]` (indexed by VFO); `AM_fix_get_gain_diff`
  now takes an `unsigned vfo` parameter.  Call sites updated:
  `ui/main.c` passes `gEeprom.RX_VFO`; `app/spectrum.c` passes the module-scope `vfo`.

- **[P3] `driver/bk4819.c` comment arithmetic error** —
  The `BK4819_GetRSSI_dBm` documentation comment stated
  `raw 511 → −104.5 dBm`, but `(511 + 1) / 2 − 160 = +96 dBm`.
  Corrected to `raw 130 → −95 dBm`, which matches the AM Fix AGC target and is
  easily verified: `130 × 0.5 − 160 = −95 dBm`.

### Deferred — requires design / more analysis

- `app/dtmf.c` `DTMF_FindContact` — unbounded `pResult` write; all current callers
  pass adequately-sized buffers; API change is invasive, deferred to Phase 2.
- `am_fix.c` `memmove` size error — the buggy path is under `#if !LOOKUP_TABLE`
  which is compile-time dead (`#define LOOKUP_TABLE 1`); deferred.
- `driver/uart.c` interrupt-disable scope — architectural change, needs careful design.
- `audio.c` voice queue — only active when `ENABLE_VOICE` is set (off by default).
- `app/spectrum.c` RSSI busy-wait / `driver/bk4819.c` IRQ loop — behavioural change
  risk, deferred.
